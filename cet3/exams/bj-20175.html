                        People say that money cannot buy happiness. This was true for Howard Hughes. (76) He was one of the richest and most powerful men of his time. He had everything: good look success, power, and a lot of money. But he didn't have love or friendship because he couldn't buy them. All his life he used his money to control everything and everyone around him. In the end, he lost control of everything, even himself.
